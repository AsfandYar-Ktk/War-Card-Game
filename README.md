# War - A Card Game (OOP)  

This is an object-oriented implementation of the classic card game **War**, developed as part of the *Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp 2023* course. The game is played between a user and the computer, following a structured set of rules.  

## **Game Rules (Implementation-Specific)**  
- Each player draws **one card** from their deck. The player with the higher card wins and takes both cards.  
- If both cards are **equal**, a **War** occurs:  
  - Each player draws **three additional cards** face down.  
  - Then, they draw **one more card** and compare it.  
  - The player with the higher last-drawn card wins **all the cards** in the War pile.  
  - If a tie happens again, another War follows the same process.  
- The game continues until one player **runs out of cards**, and the other player is declared the winner.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts  

## **How to Play**  
1. Run the Python script.  
2. Enter your name when prompted.  
3. The game progresses automatically, displaying each roundâ€™s results.  
4. The winner is declared when one player has all the cards.  

## **Features**  
âœ… OOP-based structure with `Deck`, `Hand`, `Player`, and `War` classes  
âœ… Fair, randomized deck shuffling  
âœ… Automatic game logic with round-by-round updates  
âœ… War mechanics for resolving ties  

Enjoy playing **War**! ðŸš€
